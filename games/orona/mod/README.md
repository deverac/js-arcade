# Bolo

Bolo is a top-down game of tank warfare originally written by Stuart Cheshire for the BBC Micro and
Apple Macintosh, and also notably rewritten for Windows and Linux by John Morrison.

## Orona

Orona is another rewrite of Bolo, intended to be played in any modern browser. Orona is developed
in [CoffeeScript], and relies on some of the newer technologies made possible by HTML5.

The name comes from an uninhabited island situated in the central Pacific Ocean.

## Playing Orona

Orona is alpha quality, but still very playable. Take a look at [GitHub Pages] to see a single
player game in action, which should work on most modern browsers.

If you're seeing odd things in your browser, take a look at the [browser compatibility] wiki page,
and feel free to extend it with your experiences. [Issue] reports are also welcome.

## Running an Orona server

Currently, you need [Node.js] 0.6 and [git] to run Orona. To build and run:

    git clone https://github.com/stephank/orona.git
    cd orona
    git submodule update --init
    npm install
    cake build
    bin/bolo-server

You will need a small config file; `bolo-server` will tell you how to create one. Note that the IRC
functionality is optional, but the only way to do match-making at the moment. If you don't want to
connect to an IRC network, simply remove the `irc` section from the config file.

## License

The source code of Orona is distributed with the GNU GPL version 2, as inherited from WinBolo.
Much of the game logic was written with WinBolo as a reference, thus becoming a derived work of it.
Though the GNU GPL version 2 is a fine license either way. You can find a copy of the license
in the COPYING file.

Some files, or parts of files, are subject to other licenses, where indicated in the files
themselves. A short overview of those parts follows.
